A rich man's wife fell ill, and when she felt that the end was near, she called her only daughter to her bedside and said: "Dear child, stay pious and good, and God will always help you, and I will look down on you from heaven and be with you. Then she closed her eyes and passed away. The girl went out every day to her mother's grave and wept, and remained pious and good. When winter came, the snow covered the grave with a white cloth, and when the sun came down again in spring, the man took another wife.
The woman had brought two daughters into the house, who were beautiful and white of face, but nasty and black of heart. Then a bad time began for the poor stepchild. "Let the silly goose sit with us in the parlour!" they said, "he who wants to eat bread must earn it: out with the kitchen maid!" They took away his beautiful clothes, dressed him in a grey, old smock and gave him wooden shoes. "Look at the proud princess, how she is cleaned!" they cried, laughing, and led her into the kitchen.

So he bought beautiful clothes, pearls and precious stones for the two stepsisters, and on his way back, as he rode through a green bush, a hazel rice brushed against him and knocked off his hat. So he broke off the rice and took it with him. When he came home, he gave the stepdaughters what they had wished for, and to Cinderella he gave the rice from the hazel bush. Cinderella thanked him, and went to her mother's grave, and planted the rice on it, and wept so much that the tears fell on it and watered it. But it grew and became a beautiful tree. Cinderella went under it three times a day, weeping and praying, and every time a white bird came up to the tree, and when she made a wish, the bird threw down to her what she had wished for.
But it happened that the king arranged a feast which was to last three days, and to which all the beautiful maidens in the land were invited, so that his son might choose a bride. The two
