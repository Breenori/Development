Once upon a time there was a king and a queen who said every day: "Oh, if only we had a child", but they never did. Then it happened that once the queen was sitting in the bath and a frog crawled out of the water onto the land and said to her: "Your wish will be granted, before a year passes you will give birth to a daughter.
What the frog had said came to pass, and the queen gave birth to a girl, who was so beautiful that the king could not help rejoicing and arranged a great feast. He invited not only his relatives, friends and acquaintances, but also the wise women, so that they would be kind to the child. There were thirteen of them in his kingdom, but because he had only twelve golden plates from which they were to eat, one of them had to stay at home.
The feast was celebrated with all splendour, and when it was over, the wise women presented the child with their miraculous gifts: one with virtue, another with beauty, the third with wealth, and so with everything that is to be desired in the world. When the eleven had just done their spells, the thirteenth suddenly entered. She wanted to take revenge for not being invited, and without greeting or even looking at anyone, she cried out in a loud voice: "The king's daughter shall prick herself on a spindle in her fifteenth year and fall down dead." And without speaking another word, she turned and left the hall. All were frightened, then the twelfth came forth, who still had her wish left, and because she could not annul the evil sentence, but only soften it, she said: "But it shall not be death, but a hundred years' deep sleep, into which the king's daughter shall fall."
The king, who wanted to protect his dear child from this misfortune, gave orders that all the spindles in the whole kingdom should be burnt. But the gifts of the wise women were all fulfilled in the girl, for she was so beautiful, demure, friendly and intelligent that everyone who looked at her had to love her. It happened that on the day she was fifteen years old, the king and queen were not at home and the girl was left all alone in the castle. So she went around everywhere, looking at rooms and chambers as she pleased, and finally came to an old tower. She climbed the narrow spiral staircase and came to a small door. There was a rusty key in the lock, and when he turned it, the door burst open, and there, sitting in a little room, was an old woman with a spindle, busily spinning her flax.
"Good day, you old mother," said the king's daughter, "what are you doing?" - I am spinning," said the old woman, nodding her head. "What is that thing that jumps about so merrily?" said the girl, taking the spindle and wanting to spin too. But no sooner had she touched the spindle than the spell came true and she pricked her finger with it. But at the moment she felt the prick, she fell down on the bed that was standing there and lay in a deep sleep.
And this sleep spread over the whole castle: the king and queen, who had just come home and had entered the hall, began to fall asleep, and all the court with them. Then the horses in the stable, the dogs in the courtyard, the pigeons on the roof, the flies on the wall, yes, the fire that was flickering on the hearth became quiet and fell asleep, and the roast stopped sizzling, and the cook, who wanted to pull the kitchen boy's hair because he had done something wrong, let him go and slept. And the wind died down, and not a leaf was stirring on the trees in front of the castle. Around the castle, however, a hedge of thorns began to grow, which grew higher every year, and at last surrounded the whole castle and grew beyond it, so that nothing could be seen of it, not even the flag on the roof.
But there was a legend in the country about the beautiful sleeping Sleeping Beauty, for that was the name of the king's daughter, so that from time to time the king's sons came and wanted to enter the castle through the hedge. But they could not, for the thorns, as if they had hands, held tightly together, and the young men got caught in them, could not get loose again and died a miserable death.
En rigmands kone blev syg, og da hun følte, at det var ved at være slut, kaldte hun sin eneste datter til sig og sagde: "Kært barn, bliv from og god, så vil Gud altid hjælpe dig, og jeg vil se ned på dig fra himlen og være hos dig. Så lukkede hun øjnene og døde. Pigen gik hver dag ud til sin mors grav og græd, men forblev from og god. Når vinteren kom, dækkede sneen graven med et hvidt klæde, og da solen kom ned igen om foråret, tog manden sig en anden kone.
Kvinden havde bragt to døtre ind i huset, som var smukke og hvide i ansigtet, men onde og sorte i hjertet. Så begyndte en dårlig tid for det stakkels stedbarn. "Lad den dumme gås sidde med os i stuen!" sagde de, "den, der vil have brød, må tjene det: ud med køkkenpigen!" De tog hans smukke tøj fra ham og klædte ham i en grå, gammel kittel og gav ham træsko. "Se på den stolte prinsesse, hvor hun er blevet renset!" råbte de og grinede og førte hende ind i køkkenet. Der måtte hun arbejde hårdt fra morgen til aften, stå tidligt op om morgenen, bære vand, tænde ild, lave mad og vaske. Desuden udsatte søstrene ham for alle mulige hjertesorger, hånede ham og hældte ærter og linser ned i asken, så han måtte sidde og plukke dem ud igen. Om aftenen, da han havde arbejdet sig i søvn, kunne han ikke komme i seng, men måtte lægge sig ved siden af komfuret i asken. Og fordi hun altid så støvet og beskidt ud, kaldte de hende Askepot.
Det skete, at faderen en dag ville gå til messe, så han spurgte de to steddøtre, hvad han skulle tage med til dem. "Smukke klæder," sagde den ene, "perler og ædelsten," sagde den anden. "Men dig, Askepot," sagde han, "hvad vil du?" - "Far, den første ris, der støder på din hat på vej hjem, skal du brække den af for mig!" Han købte smukke klæder, perler og ædelstene til de to stedsøstre, og da han red gennem en grøn busk på vej tilbage, strejfede et hasselris ham og slog hans hat af. Så han brød risene af og tog dem med sig. Da han kom hjem, gav han steddøtrene det, de havde ønsket sig, og Askepot fik risene fra hasselbusken. Askepot takkede ham og gik hen til sin mors grav og plantede riset på den og græd så meget, at tårerne faldt på den og vandede den. Men det voksede og blev et smukt træ. Askepot gik under træet tre gange om dagen og græd og bad, og hver gang kom der en hvid fugl til træet, og når hun ønskede noget, kastede fuglen det ned til hende, som hun havde ønsket sig.
Men det skete, at kongen arrangerede en fest, som skulle vare tre dage, og hvortil alle landets smukke piger var inviteret, for at hans søn kunne vælge en brud. De to
